# DeltaPred
 Interactive Model Prediction & Visualization

 ðŸš§ **This project is currently in the prototype phase.**  
Expect frequent updates, and features may change or be incomplete.

## Introduction  
DeltaPred is an interactive model prediction and visualization tool built with **Streamlit** and **Plotly**.

This project was initiated based on experience with structured data competitions, particularly in **regression** and **time-series forecasting**. In many cases, when working with domain-specific datasets, predictions may deviate unexpectedly, requiring in-depth analysis to determine the cause.

For example, in fields like **manufacturing process data**, where the dataset captures the flow of operations, domain expertise can be leveraged to test **how modifying certain input variables impacts the target outcome**. By allowing users to interactively adjust feature values and observe prediction changes, DeltaPred serves as a valuable tool for **debugging models and gaining deeper insights into data-driven decision-making**.

With DeltaPred, users can:
- Upload pre-trained models (**XGBoost, PyTorch, Scikit-learn**)
- Upload datasets (**CSV format**)
- Visualize actual vs. predicted values
- Modify feature values interactively to observe changes in predictions
- Export modified predictions for further analysis
